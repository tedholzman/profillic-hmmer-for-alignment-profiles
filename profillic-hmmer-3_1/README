This is profillic-hmmer, modified versions of HMMER 3 programs to
implement interoperability with galosh profiles (as generated by
profillic).  Please see the document CITING, which should have been
included with this file.  You may use at will, subject to the license
(GPL v3), but *please cite the relevant papers* in your
documentation and publications associated with uses of this library.
Thank you!
